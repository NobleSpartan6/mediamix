      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks are well-defined. For further granularity, consider if 'Global CSS (Inter typeface, fade motion)' needs to be a distinct step from 'Tailwind CSS with Design Tokens', or if the Tailwind configuration subtask can fully encompass these global style definitions. Also, ensure the test strategy for each subtask is clear.",
      "reasoning": "The task involves integrating several core technologies with specific configurations (design tokens, fonts, UI libraries). The existing 4 subtasks effectively break down the setup process into manageable, distinct configuration areas."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks are appropriate. For the 'Install and Configure Zustand Store' subtask, ensure the initial schema for 'imported file info, beat markers, timeline data' is clearly defined. For 'Create Stub Files', ensure all listed files (`workers/proxy.ts`, `export/segment.ts`, etc.) are covered.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a lightweight state management library (Zustand) and creating placeholder files, which are relatively low-complexity activities. The existing 3 subtasks adequately cover these aspects."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "The existing 5 subtasks are comprehensive. For 'Implement H.264/H.265 Codec Support Check', ensure the subtask details include researching and listing the specific codec strings (e.g., 'avc1.42E01E') to be tested for both H.264 and H.265, and how to derive these from a file if possible, or common profiles to check. For 'Robust Error Handling', list specific error scenarios to cover (API unavailable, file type mismatch, codec unsupported, user cancellation).",
      "reasoning": "This task involves modern browser APIs (File System Access, WebCodecs) which can have nuances in implementation and cross-browser behavior. The 5 existing subtasks thoroughly cover UI, data handling, codec checking, error management, and testing."

      "expansionPrompt": "The 7 subtasks are well-structured. For 'Implement Audio Track Extraction', detail the decision criteria for using WebCodecs vs. ffmpeg.wasm. For 'Design and Implement Beat Detection Algorithm', specify initial algorithm approaches to research (e.g., energy-based, spectral flux) and parameters for `AnalyserNode`. For 'Develop Comprehensive Beat Detection Tests', list types of audio samples to use (e.g., clear rhythm, complex rhythm, no rhythm, different genres).",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex, involving audio demuxing (potentially with ffmpeg.wasm), Web Worker implementation, advanced Web Audio API usage, and the design of a non-trivial beat detection algorithm. The 7 existing subtasks provide a good breakdown of these challenging components."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "The 7 subtasks are well-defined. For 'Integrate `react-moveable`', detail the specific `react-moveable` props/events to be used (e.g., `draggable`, `resizable`, `onDrag`, `onResize`). For 'Implement Initial Keyboard Shortcuts', clarify if these are global or context-specific to the timeline. For 'Conduct Initial Performance Testing', specify metrics beyond FPS (e.g., rendering time for N clips).",
      "reasoning": "Developing a performant and interactive timeline with `react-moveable`, auto-slicing, keyboard controls, and styling is a significant UI engineering challenge. The 7 existing subtasks effectively break this down."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks covering: 1. `ffmpeg.wasm` setup (threads, SIMD, worker). 2. Timeline-to-`ffmpeg`-command generation logic (handling clip concatenation, scaling, 30s limit). 3. `ffmpeg.wasm` execution, progress parsing, and output file handling. 4. Initial performance/memory testing. 5. Dedicated optimization phase for KPIs. For subtask 2, detail how to handle multiple clips (e.g., `concat` filter vs. protocol, temporary files).",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to `ffmpeg.wasm` (with threads/SIMD), dynamic `ffmpeg` command generation from timeline data, off-main-thread processing, progress reporting, and stringent performance/memory KPIs. Breaking it down is crucial."

      "expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks are appropriate. For 'Orchestrate Beat Detection Service Call', clarify if it should re-run detection if beats already exist or use existing ones. For 'Implement User Feedback System', specify the types of feedback (e.g., modal spinner, toast notifications for success/error) and at which stages of the macro they should appear.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves orchestrating previously developed features (import, beat detection, auto-slicing). The complexity lies in the coordination and user feedback rather than new algorithmic development. The 5 existing subtasks cover these aspects well."

      "expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks are well-defined. For 'Create CI Workflow File', specify the triggers (e.g., push to `main`, PRs to `main`). For 'Define & Document Manual Accessibility Contrast Check Process', list specific tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, axe DevTools extension) to be used for the audit and the target WCAG level (AA 4.5:1).",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a basic CI pipeline involves standard steps but requires familiarity with CI tooling. The manual accessibility check is procedural. The 5 existing subtasks provide a clear path for implementation."

Test Scenarios & Methodology' subtask (1, 3, 5), ensure it includes specifying target hardware/software configurations for testing. For each 'Profile & Optimize...' subtask (2, 4, 6), suggest initial areas or hypotheses to investigate based on the feature's implementation (e.g., for export: ffmpeg command efficiency, data copying; for timeline: React component memoization, event handling).",
      "reasoning": "This task is inherently complex as it involves deep analysis, iterative optimization, and specialized tooling to meet stringent performance KPIs across different application aspects (export, UI interaction, memory). The 7 existing subtasks provide a structured approach to this demanding work."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "The 7 subtasks are well-defined. For subtasks 1-4 (keyboard shortcuts), specify whether these shortcuts should be global or context-aware (e.g., active only when timeline has focus). For subtask 6 ('Apply and Style Tooltips'), list key UI elements that must have tooltips and provide a visual reference or more detailed description for 'CapCut minimal style'.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing robust keyboard shortcuts requires careful event handling and state integration. Tooltip integration is simpler with a library but requires attention to styling and coverage. The 7 existing subtasks break this down effectively, especially by separating each shortcut."
