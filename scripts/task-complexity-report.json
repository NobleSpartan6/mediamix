      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 0,
      "expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as existing subtasks are comprehensive and complete. If new import-related features arise (e.g., cloud import, advanced metadata), they would warrant new subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "The task involves multiple modern browser APIs (File System Access, WebCodecs) and state management, requiring careful error handling and testing. The existing 5 subtasks thoroughly cover these aspects and are marked as complete, indicating the initial complexity was well-managed."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Beat Detection on Audio Track",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Further break down 'Design and Implement Beat Detection Algorithm' into: 1. Research and select beat detection techniques, 2. Implement prototype algorithm, 3. Tune algorithm parameters and evaluate accuracy. Detail 'Implement Audio Track Extraction' with sub-steps for `ffmpeg.wasm` integration if chosen, focusing on efficient demuxing and handling various audio formats.",
      "reasoning": "Involves complex audio processing (demuxing, FFT, custom algorithm design), Web Workers for concurrency, and potentially `ffmpeg.wasm`. The core algorithm design and audio extraction are significant efforts that would benefit from more detailed sub-tasking for better tracking and management."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Timeline UI with Auto-Slicing at Beats",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the state management strategy for selected clips and playhead position to support keyboard shortcuts (I, O). Break down 'Conduct Initial Performance Testing and Optimization' into specific interaction profiling (e.g., drag, trim, zoom) and targeted optimization steps for `react-moveable` and React rendering to meet FPS goals.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating `react-moveable` for complex interactions (drag, trim) while maintaining high performance (â‰¥50-60fps) is challenging. State management for keyboard shortcuts, auto-slicing logic, and ensuring smooth UI responsiveness add significant complexity. Performance aspects and detailed shortcut interactions warrant further breakdown."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Video Export (30s 1080p MP4)",
      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Elaborate on 'Develop Timeline-to-FFmpeg Command Generation Logic' by creating subtasks for: 1. Handling multi-clip concatenation (filter vs. protocol), 2. Dynamic scaling filter application, 3. Precise 30-second output trimming logic. Further detail 'Dedicated Optimization Phase for KPIs' with subtasks for specific KPI targets (speed, memory) and methods (e.g., command tuning, memory profiling, worker data transfer optimization).",
      "reasoning": "`ffmpeg.wasm` integration with threads/SIMD, complex dynamic `ffmpeg` command generation (concatenation, scaling, trimming from timeline state), and meeting strict performance/memory KPIs make this task exceptionally complex. The command generation and optimization phases are substantial and require finer-grained subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement \"Cut to the Beat\" AI Macro",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 1,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define a comprehensive error handling strategy for each step of the macro (video check, beat detection initiation, auto-slicing trigger). Specify how errors are gracefully communicated to the user and how the system recovers or guides the user. Detail the UI/UX for prompting video import if none is loaded when the macro is triggered.",
      "reasoning": "This task orchestrates several other complex features. While the individual steps are covered by existing subtasks, ensuring smooth end-to-end flow, robust error handling across the sequence, managing intermediate states, and providing clear user feedback for a multi-stage process adds moderate complexity. Focus on the orchestration and UX aspects."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 0,
      "expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as existing subtasks are specific and cover the scope well. Consider adding a future subtask for automating parts of the accessibility contrast check using tools like `axe-core` within the CI pipeline, if feasible.",
      "reasoning": "Involves standard CI setup (lint, type check, tests) and defining/performing a manual accessibility audit. The existing subtasks are granular and cover these aspects well. The complexity is mainly in the initial setup, configuration, and documentation of the manual process."

      "taskId": 9,
      "title": "Performance Profiling & Optimization for KPIs",
      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "For each primary KPI (Export Time, Interaction FPS, Memory Usage), break down its respective 'Profile & Optimize' subtask. For Export Time: 1. Profile ffmpeg.wasm command execution, 2. Optimize data transfer to/from worker and FS. For Interaction FPS: 1. Profile React component rendering on complex timelines, 2. Optimize `react-moveable` event handling and updates. For Memory Usage: 1. Profile ArrayBuffer management during export, 2. Investigate and fix potential memory leaks in wasm/JS bridge.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the stringent, multi-faceted performance KPIs requiring deep profiling and optimization across different parts of the application (ffmpeg.wasm, React UI, Web Workers). Each KPI optimization is a significant effort involving specialized tools and techniques, warranting more granular subtasks for focused work."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Keyboard Parity and Tooltips",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 1,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the state management requirements for 'selected clip' and 'playhead position' to ensure robust interaction with I/O/C keyboard shortcuts. Specify fallback behavior or clear user feedback for conceptual shortcuts (C for cut, Space for play/pause) until their full functionality is implemented, ensuring users understand their current limitations.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing robust keyboard shortcuts requires careful state management (selected items, playhead context) and event handling. While tooltip integration is simpler, ensuring consistency and the specified style across many elements takes effort. The 'conceptual' nature of some shortcuts requires clear planning for current stubs and future integration."
