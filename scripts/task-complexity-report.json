      "expansionPrompt": "Further detail the integration points, critical dependencies, and acceptance criteria for each of the 13 defined subtasks. Prioritize subtasks to unblock core functionality and enable early performance validation, ensuring cohesion towards the single PR goal.",
      "reasoning": "Extremely high complexity due to vast scope (UI, interactions, performance, AI), stringent 'John Carmack Litmus' performance targets (60fps, <8ms tasks, 1000s of clips), integration of diverse technologies (React, WebGL, OTIO, AI), and the requirement for a single cohesive PR. The 13 existing subtasks reflect this breadth."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down video export into: 1. `ffmpeg.wasm` (threads, SIMD) setup & basic single clip processing. 2. OTIO-to-ffmpeg command generation for multi-clip sequences. 3. Web Worker integration with progress updates & error handling. 4. Output scaling, encoding (H.264 ultrafast), and file download. 5. Performance profiling and optimization against KPIs (export time, RAM). 6. UI for triggering export and displaying progress/results.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to `ffmpeg.wasm` integration with threads/SIMD, Web Worker management, OTIO data parsing, multi-clip concatenation logic, specific performance KPIs, and robust error handling for media processing."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for 'Cut to the Beat': 1. UI element (e.g., button) implementation and asset selection logic. 2. Orchestration logic to invoke `useBeatSlices(assetId)` (including beat detection trigger if needed) and handle its output. 3. Integration with timeline for displaying newly sliced clips and AI ghost markers. 4. User feedback mechanisms (loading states, success/error messages).",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity; primarily an integration task leveraging the `useBeatSlices` hook and existing timeline functionality. Complexity stems from UI/UX, state management for selected asset, and coordinating asynchronous operations."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down CI setup into: 1. Base CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) for linting, type checking, and Vitest unit/integration tests. 2. `axe-core` integration into E2E tests (e.g., `cypress-axe`) or as a separate CI job. 3. Configuration of `axe-core` rules, reporting, and PR failure conditions for critical/serious violations. 4. Documentation of CI jobs and process for manual accessibility audits (contrast, keyboard nav). 5. Setup for PR status checks, notifications, and CI badges.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity. Standard CI setup is straightforward, but robust accessibility integration (automated Axe-core, defining manual check processes for WCAG AA) requires careful configuration and process definition."

Profiling & optimization for Scroll Performance (React commit ≤5ms). 4. Profiling & optimization for Worker Canvas Impact (<4ms main-thread). 5. Profiling & optimization for Interaction FPS (drag/trim ≥55 FPS). 6. Profiling & optimization for Import & UI Interactivity (<0.7s). 7. Establish consistent benchmarking environment and methodology for all KPIs.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity. Achieving multiple, aggressive, and specific performance KPIs for the Timeline MVP requires dedicated, systematic profiling, deep technical expertise, and iterative optimization across React, JS, DOM, and rendering paths. This is a significant effort beyond initial implementation."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down keyboard/tooltip implementation: 1. Finalize and document the comprehensive keyboard shortcut map for all timeline operations. 2. Implement global and component-specific keyboard event handlers for navigation, editing, and playback. 3. Integrate Radix UI Tooltip for all major interactive controls with specified styling (minimal, 150ms fade). 4. Ensure comprehensive focus management and WCAG AA compliant focus rings for all interactive elements. 5. Thoroughly test all keyboard shortcuts, tooltip appearance, and accessibility features.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-High complexity. Implementing a truly 'full' keyboard map for a complex editor like the timeline is extensive and requires careful state management. Consistently applying and styling accessible Radix UI tooltips with correct focus behavior adds significant effort."
